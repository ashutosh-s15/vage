          <p class="content">
            At Vage, we believe that creating visual representations should be
            free of the limitations of tools, and as easy as expressing your
            ideas through hand gestures. Our AI and computer vision technology
            makes drawing, sketching, and designing an intuitive experience,
            without the need for touch screens, mouse, or light pens. With an
            easy-to-use interface and gesture recognition capabilities, users
            can effortlessly access a variety of tools for designing, learning,
            and presentation purposes. Our mission is to make creativity
            accessible to everyone, by enabling a more natural and seamless way
            to express ideas.

          <h2>The Software</h2>
          <p class="content">
            The Vage is a AI virtual canvas desktop application built using
            Electron JS and a variety of open-source tools and frameworks. The
            application leverages
            <span class="imp">Google's Mediapipe</span>
            framework for hand tracking, enabling users to draw and create
            designs using their hands. In the backend, the application uses
            <span class="imp">OpenCV with Python</span>
            to provide computer vision capabilities, enabling the application to
            recognize and interpret hand movements accurately.<br /><br />
            For the user interface, the application uses HTML, CSS, and JS in
            the Electron.js framework, allowing for a seamless and intuitive
            user experience. To facilitate communication between the backend
            Python modules and the Electron.js scripts, the application uses the
            <span class="imp">Python-shell</span>
            NPM package, making it easy to incorporate the Python code into the
            Electron.js environment. <br /><br />
            To perform complex mathematical calculations, the application uses
            the <span class="imp">Numpy</span> package, which provides efficient
            and fast array operations and mathematical functions. The result is
            a powerful and intuitive application that enables users to create
            sketches using only their hands. The combination of these
            technologies results in a unique and engaging experience that
            empowers users to explore their creativity in a whole new way.
